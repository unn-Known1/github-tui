# GitHub TUI

A fast, zero-dependency terminal user interface for GitHub — six tabs, a command palette, an in-terminal file explorer that can clone or save anything to your CWD, an inbox triage workflow, themes, persistent bookmarks & pins, OSC-52 clipboard, ETag-aware caching, mouse support, collapsible sections, and comprehensive repo analytics. All driven by your keyboard (and mouse).

## ✨ Highlights

- 🏠 **Real Dashboard** — greeting + 5 stat cards (★ stars, ⑂ forks, ◆ languages, ⏱ account age, ⚠ stale repos), profile mini with recent followers, **contribution heatmap**, **star history sparkline**, top repos, language bar chart, live activity feed, **recent issues/PRs**, stale repos alert, trending-this-week, unread-notifications badge, **collapsible sections**.
- 📁 **Repos browser, supercharged** — row selection (`▶`), `Enter` drills into Analyze details, sortable columns, **type filter cycle** (`t`: all/sources/forks/archived/private/public/templates), **language facet** (`L`), **stale-only** toggle (`x`), **density toggle** (`D` switches between compact and comfortable), **pinned favorites** (`P` — stick to top, persisted on disk), inline visibility badges (🔒 private, 🔱 fork, 📦 archived, 🗄 template, 📌 pinned, ★ bookmarked), `g`/`G` jump-to-top/bottom.
- 🗂️ **File explorer** — `F` on Analyze details opens a real in-terminal repo browser. Walk the tree, view files with line numbers + naive syntax coloring, switch branches, **save individual files** (`s`), **save whole folders** recursively (`S`), **download zipballs** (`Z`) streamed straight to disk, **`git clone`** into your CWD (`C`), **`gh repo clone`** for private repos (`G`), copy raw URLs (`y`) or file contents (`Y`) to clipboard.
- 🔍 **Analyze any public repo** — search, 2-column detail view (metadata + languages bar + top contributors + latest releases), pane tabs `[O] Overview / [i] Issues / [P] PRs / [R] README / [F] Files / [T] Traffic / [M] Milestones / [L] Labels / [K] Checks / [S] Security`, parallel ahead/behind compares on forks.
- 📊 **Repo Analytics** — Traffic (views/clones/popular paths/referrers), Milestones (title/state/due/issues), Labels (color dots/descriptions), Checks/CI (pass/fail/pending summary), Security (Dependabot alerts with severity icons).
- 📥 **Inbox triage** — color-coded notification types, mark-as-read (`m`) / mark-all (`M`) / unsubscribe (`u`) / filter cycle (`f`: all/unread/mentions/review), repo-grouped summary.
- 🎨 **Themes** — `default`, `highContrast`, `dracula`, `solarized`, `nord`, `monokai`, `gruvbox` — persisted across sessions.
- ⚡ **Command Palette** — `Ctrl-P` or `:` opens a fuzzy-search modal listing every action.
- 📖 **README viewer** — `R` on the details pane renders the repo's README in-terminal with naive Markdown styling.
- ★ **Star anywhere** — `s` toggles a GitHub star on the highlighted repo (search results / details / forks / your repos).
- 📋 **OSC-52 clipboard** — `y` copies the current URL; works over SSH and inside tmux.
- 📉 **Live rate-limit indicator** — top-right of the screen; full breakdown (remaining/limit/reset minutes + **token scopes**) on the Settings tab.
- 💾 **ETag caching** — repeated GETs return 304 and don't cost any rate-limit budget. Disk-backed with LRU eviction, survives restarts.
- 🛡️ **Offline mode** — shows cached data with `⚠ OFFLINE` banner when network is unavailable.
- 📡 **Last-synced timestamps** — every tab shows when data was last refreshed.
- 📦 **Cache stats** — header shows cache size in KB; Settings → System shows full breakdown.
- 🔐 **Secure local auth** — PAT stored in the **OS keychain** (macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret, Windows Credential Manager); falls back to `~/.github-tui/token` with `chmod 600` when no keychain is available. Existing plaintext tokens are auto-migrated on first run. Masked while typing; auto-cleared on first 401.
- 🖥️ **Diff-based renderer** — only changed cells are redrawn; resizes adaptively.
- 📝 **Issue/PR detail popup** — `Enter` on an issue or PR opens a full detail view with rendered body, labels, comments tab, **reviews tab**, and PR files tab. Comment (`c`), react (`r`), close/reopen (`x`), merge PR (`M`) — all from the TUI.
- 🔀 **PR diff viewer** — Files tab in the detail popup shows changed files with `+/-` stats. Select a file to view its unified diff with syntax-colored additions/deletions.
- 🖱️ **Mouse support** — click tabs, pane tabs, list items; scroll wheel navigation; hover effects with row highlighting on all list views.
- 📂 **Collapsible sections** — `z` toggle, `Z` collapse all, `X` expand all. State persisted to disk (`~/.github-tui/collapsed.json`).
- 📈 **Rate limit visual bar** — real-time `█░` indicator in the header showing API quota usage.
- 🎯 **Context-aware help** — `?` shows current tab's shortcuts first.
- ✏️ **Input cursor movement** — arrow keys, Home/End, Ctrl-A/E/U/W in all text inputs.
- 🛡️ **Graceful shutdown** — atomic signal handling, raw mode restored, debug logging on crash.

## 🗂️ Project Layout

The app is split into 24 focused modules. Adding a new tab is: create one file, register it in `state.mjs`, import it in `render.mjs` and `keys.mjs`. The command palette picks up new actions automatically when you call `palette.register({ id, label, run })`.

Every tab module exports `render(screen, y, h)`, an optional `keys` map for tab-local hotkeys, and optional `up`/`down`/`enter`/`space` dispatchers.

## 🧱 What Each Tab Shows

### 1 · Dashboard
- Time-of-day greeting (`Good morning/afternoon/evening, <you>`) with 🔔 unread badge.
- 5 stat cards: ★ Total Stars, ⑂ Total Forks, ◆ Distinct Languages, ⏱ Account Age, ⚠ Stale Repos. `Tab` to focus, `←/→` to move, `Enter` to drill in (e.g. Stale → Repos with stale filter).
- **Left:** profile mini (`@login`, email, followers/following counts, recent followers list), **contribution heatmap** (15-week grid from PushEvents), **star history sparkline** (last 30 days), top 5 repos by stars, language bar chart across all your repos.
- **Right:** Recent Activity feed (last ~10 events with colored icons per type + relative timestamps), **Recent Issues** (across your repos), **Recent Pull Requests** (across your repos), **Stale Repos Alert** (60+ days no push), 🔥 Trending This Week (top 5 public repos created in last 7 days, sorted by stars).
- **Collapsible sections** — all sections can be collapsed/expanded with `z`/`Z`/`X`.

### 2 · Repos
- Header shows aggregate **★/⑂/⚡** totals across all your repos plus archived count.
- **Dismissible filter chips** above the list — each chip has an `✕` to remove just that filter. `c` still clears all in one go.
- Sortable columns and a substring filter (`/`).
- **Type cycle (`t`)** lets you jump straight to sources / forks / archived / private / public / templates.
- **Language facet (`L`)** narrows to one language.
- **Stale-only (`x`)** surfaces side-projects with no push in 6+ months.
- **Density (`D`)** toggles between compact (1 line/row) and comfortable (description shown on row+1).
- **Pins (`P`)** float favorites to the top with a `★ PINNED` section header — persisted on disk so they survive restarts.
- Each row shows visibility badges (🔒 private, 🔱 fork, 📦 archived, 🗄 template, 📌 pinned, ★ bookmarked) and a relative push time.
- `Space` paginates beyond the first 30. `Enter` opens the repo in Analyze details.

### 3 · Analyze
- Search any public repo. `Enter` opens a 2-column detail view.
- **Pane tabs:** `[O] Overview`, `[i] Issues (N)`, `[P] PRs (N)`, `[R] README`, `[F] Files`, `[T] Traffic`, `[M] Milestones`, `[L] Labels`, `[K] Checks`, `[S] Security`.
- Overview = metadata column + (languages bar chart / top contributors / latest releases) column.
- README pane renders Markdown with naive styling (headings bold, lists in accent color, code fences dimmed).
- **Traffic pane** = views, clones, popular paths, popular referrers.
- **Milestones pane** = title, state, due date, open/closed issues.
- **Labels pane** = color dots, name, description.
- **Checks/CI pane** = check runs with pass/fail/pending summary.
- **Security pane** = Dependabot alerts with severity icons.
- **Files pane** = full in-terminal file browser + viewer with save/clone/zipball actions (see above).
- From details: `Enter` opens Forks with ahead/behind columns; `Space` paginates more.

### 4 · Settings
- **Actions:** Login, Logout, Refresh Dashboard, Refresh User Data, **Change Theme**, Clear Token File, Token display.
- **System panel:** app version, config dir, token file path, Node version, platform/arch, terminal size, **API remaining / limit / reset-in minutes**, **token scopes**.

### 5 · Inbox
- Per-row: ▶ selection, ● yellow unread dot, color-coded subject type (PR/cyan, Issue/yellow, Release/green, Discussion/magenta, Commit/blue, CheckSuite/red), repo·title, reason, relative time.
- Header shows unread/total counts + active filter (`all` / `unread` / `mentions` / `review`).
- Right-side **By Repo** widget — top 5 noisiest repos with counts.
- Triage actions: `m`/`M`/`u`/`f`.

## 🧠 Design Notes

- **Zero npm dependencies.** Only Node's built-in `https`, `fs`, `os`, `path`, `child_process`. Tests use Node's built-in test runner.
- **Secure token storage.** PAT is stored in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret / Windows Credential Manager) using only built-in CLI tools — no npm packages. Falls back to `chmod 600` plaintext when no keychain is available. Existing plaintext tokens are silently migrated.
- **Single source of truth.** `tui/state.mjs` holds one `appState` object. ESM live bindings mean every module sees updates instantly without a pub/sub layer.
- **Pure business logic.** `repos-logic.mjs` contains testable functions decoupled from global state — `sortRepos`, `applyAllFilters`, `floatPinsToTop` accept parameters, not globals.
- **Stale-async guard.** Every long-running fetch grabs a generation number from `startAsync()`. If the user navigates away, `isStale(gen)` returns true and results are discarded. No "snap-back" to old state.
- **Bounded concurrency.** Fork ahead/behind compares run with a 5-worker pool. Folder-save uses a 4-worker pool. Dashboard widgets and repo details enrichment fetch in parallel with per-call fault tolerance.
- **ETag cache.** Every GET response with an `ETag` header is cached; subsequent identical GETs send `If-None-Match` and a 304 returns the cached body for free (no rate-limit cost).
- **Streaming downloads.** Zipballs never buffer in memory — they pipe straight to disk via Node's `https`.
- **CWD safety.** Every disk write goes through `safeCwdJoin` which refuses any path that would escape `process.cwd()`. Clones refuse to overwrite an existing directory.
- **Diff-based renderer.** `tui/screen.mjs` uses buffer swapping (zero allocation after warm-up) and only emits cursor moves + characters that actually changed.
- **Cross-platform rendering.** Box-drawing characters fall back to ASCII on Windows. `FORCE_COLOR`/`NO_COLOR` env vars respected.
- **Theme-aware rendering.** Tab renderers call `theme.color('star')` instead of hardcoding `'yellow'`, so new themes drop in without touching any tab.
- **Command palette.** Actions register themselves; the palette is just a fuzzy filter over the registry. New features can expose actions without touching any UI code.
- **Mouse support.** Full mouse tracking with click, scroll wheel, and hover effects on all list views.
- **Collapsible sections.** All sections across Dashboard, Repos, Analyze, and Inbox can be collapsed/expanded. State persisted to disk.
- **Graceful shutdown.** Single atomic handler restores raw mode, disables mouse, clears screen — no double-calls, no broken terminals.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Token is stored in the OS keychain where available (macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret, Windows Credential Manager). On systems without a supported keychain tool, it falls back to plaintext with `chmod 600` file permissions.
- Mostly read-only client today — actions ship in waves:
  - ✅ **shipped:** star/unstar, bookmark, pin, save file, save folder, zipball, `git clone`, `gh clone`, notification mark/unsubscribe.
  - ✅ **shipped (v0.5):** commenting on issues/PRs, reactions, close/reopen, merge PRs, PR diff viewer, review comments.
  - ✅ **shipped (v0.5.8):** rate limit indicator, traffic/milestones/labels/checks/security panes, mouse support, collapsible sections, hover effects, followers section, Windows and terminal icon compatibility, File Explorer selection fixes, help overlay scroll clamping.
- Only the GitHub REST v3 API is used (no GraphQL yet).
- Requires a true TTY — won't run when stdin is piped.
- The naive file-viewer syntax coloring is style-only — no real lexer. Adequate for reading, not editing.
